An analysis was completed on the PyCity School data.  First by whole district, 15 Schools, 39,170 students and an overall passing grade of 65.17%.  Next we went a layer deeper and did an analysis of the schools.  There are district and charter schools with varying funding and student counts. We looked at the budget per student and broke out the passing grades for each school.  Finally we did a summary analysis on the schools with the top and bottom performing schools, the passing percentages by grade, scores by school spending and also by school size.

Some interesting findings came through.  
1. Chater schools outperformed district schools.
2. Increased spending per student did not correlate to higher passing percentages.
3. Small and Medium sized schools greatly outperformed the Large schools especially in math.
